# Novel-Computational-Approach-to-the-Riemann-Hypothesis
A self-coded computational tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to explore the Riemann Hypothesis. It calculates and visualizes approximate zeros of the zeta function, revealing hidden numerical patterns along the critical line — a creative attempt by a high school student to approach one of math’s greatest unsolved problems.
